# Project description

With increasing renewable engergy generation and therefor rising fluctation of generated power, intelligent electricity grids are necessary for the balance between demand and the generation. The amount of feed-in power to the grid has to be at every time equal to the feed-out power, otherwise the grid gets unstable and can cause a black-out to a wider region. Also the sectors mobility, heating and industry are transforming there currently fossil-driven energy generators to electricity-based technologies, which will, despite of the conduction of energry efficiancy measures, lead to higher power demands in future.

This project uses a power plant register and measured time series of generation and consumption of Germany to provide a solid database for further electricity demand forecasts and simulations concerning different scenarios of the energetic transformation of our economies.
